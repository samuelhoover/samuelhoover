Jr. Computer Vision Engineer at [Tristar AI](https://www.tristar.ai).

I am a PPG Fellow and Chemical Engineering Ph.D. from UMass Amherst. I used a variety of computational and analytical methods to study the phase behavior and self-assembly of synthetic and biological systems in the [Muthukumar Group](http://theory.pse.umass.edu).
