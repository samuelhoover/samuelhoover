Check out my [personal webpage](https://samuelhoover.github.io) for more details about my experience and skills.

I have a Chemical Engineering Ph.D. from UMass Amherst and am PPG Fellow. I use a variety of computational and analytical methods to study the phase behavior and self-assembly of synthetic and biological systems in the [Muthukumar Group](http://theory.pse.umass.edu). I have 6 years of hands-on experience building machine learning models and developing scientific software tools for both computational chemistry and computational biology.

### Selected projects:
- Theory for pH-responsive polyzwitterion-polyelectrolyte complexation [[Ref]](https://doi.org/10.1039/D4SM00575A)
- 3D convolutional neural networks to predict adsorption properties in nanoporous materials [[Ref]](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2023/ta/d3ta01911j)
- Automation script for the senior lab course I have TA'ed, saved 8 hours over the course of the semester [[repo]](https://github.com/samuelhoover/ChE-401-402-peer-critiques-anonymizer)
- Ising model implemented in Rust: 1 billion steps, 2,000 x 2,000 square lattice, 6 seconds [[repo]](https://github.com/samuelhoover/ising-rust/)

### Projects in the pipeline:
- Explainable machine learning to study how monomer sequence impacts microphase behavior [in preparation]
- Atomistic, explicit solvent simulation to validate findings from [Chen, S. & Wang, Z.-G. *PNAS* 2022](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2209975119)
